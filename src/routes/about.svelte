    <h1>What is the Fibonacci Estimator?</h1>
    <p>
        This is a fun little project to help teams with their estimations. 
        Use it if you feel it can be useful to you.

    <h1>What is a story point?</h1>
    <p> 
        Effectively a unit of work. Over time a team has a number of story points that it can deliver in one sprint. 
        Avoid estimating with time! These are very likely to deliver inaccurate estimations without being able to get any kind of handle on team performance.
